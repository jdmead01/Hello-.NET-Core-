***Hello .NET Core!***
## Objectives

-   To ensure installation is functioning properly, and that the correct SDK version is installed
-   Get familiar with the dotnet CLI
-   To witness the output of your compiled source code
-   To understand the differences between `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, and `dotnet /path/to/YourProject.dll`

## *For this assignment, just copy the output of your console into a file, and upload.

-   run 'dotnet --version' to verify sdk is installed and in your system path
    
-   create/cd into a new project directory
    
-   run 'dotnet new console' to spin up a new console application
    
-   run 'dotnet build' to compile your C# files (here, just Program.cs) into a .dll file. note console output as to the location of this .dll file
    
-   execute your program by running the 'dotnet' command, followed by a path to your compiled .dll file
    
-   run 'dotnet run' to combine the previous two steps!
